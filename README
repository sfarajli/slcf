slcf - Suleyman's linux configuration files
===========================================
My xorg dotfiles.

Installing slcf
---------------
slcf only makes change to the user running the Makefile and doesn't affect other users,
so, it is recommended to create a new user and install slcf on the homepage of that user
and if you like it, install it on your real user.

Check the dependencies
> make depcheck

Install config and scripts
> make config scripts

Install everything
> make full
