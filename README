slcf - Suleyman's linux configuration files
===========================================
My personal dotfiles.

Installing slcf
---------------
slcf only installs dotfiles to the home directory of the user running the Makefile
and doesn't affect other users. Therefore, it's recommended to create a new user
and run make as that user. If you like the setup then you can install it for your main user.

Check the dependencies
> make depcheck

Install config and scripts
> make config scripts

Install everything
> make full
